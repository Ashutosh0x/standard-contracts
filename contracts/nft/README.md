**Important**: Due to potential Solana compatibility issues with the current version of ZetaChain localnet, **devnet testing is required** for Solana integration. Localnet testing is not required at this time.

This example currently works with devnet for Solana testing and localnet `v4.0.0-rc*` for EVM chains, which supports authenticated calls and multiple EVM chains.
